| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| database_id | A string which must be included and set to the ID of the database the scans will be validated against. |

If <b>validation_method</b> is set to <code>postback</code>:

| service_name | A string which specifies the desired name of your new service. The default is <code>Service $i</code>, where <code>$i</code> is the next available sequential number. |
| description | A string which specifies the desired description of your new service. Blank by default. |
| duplicate_value | An integer value that specifies the status of a duplicate scan if <code>validation_method</code> is set to ```database``` or ```ondevicedatabase```. Set to ```1``` for _valid_ scan status and ```0``` for _invalid_ scan status. The default status of duplicates are valid (e.g. value set to ```1```). |
| device_duplicate_value | An integer value that specifies the status of a duplicate scan when scanning on-device. Itâ€™s only for checking against scans currently stored on the device. Set to ```1``` to make the status of duplicate scans currently on the device _valid_ and set to ```0``` to make them _invalid_. The default status of duplicates on-device are valid (e.g. value set to ```1```). This only applies when the <code>validation_method</code> is set to ```record```, ```ondevicerecord```, ```database``` or ```ondevicedatabase```. NOTE: if the ```duplicate_value``` option is set to ```0``` (invalid) then this option is overridden. |
| period_start_date | A string which specifies the date when the new service should become active. Can be formatted as MM/DD/YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD (Examples: <code>12/20/2012</code> or <code>2012-12-20</code>). If this parameter is not specified, the service is always active. |

Note: All symbologies are not available to all accounts. Updating the service without submitting the 'symbologies' parameter will reset to default.  |
| enableGPS | A boolean value which makes the service submit GPS location with every scan as a scan property. If set to <code>1</code>, location will be submitted. If set to <code>0</code>, it will not be submitted. This value is set to <code>0</code> by default.
